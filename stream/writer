If you miss the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
Lord I'm one, lord I'm two
lord I'm three, lord I'm four
Lord I'm five hundred miles away from home
Away from home, ã€€Away from home
Away from home, Away from home
Lord I'm five hundred miles from my door
Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny to my name
Lord I can't go a-home this a-way
This a-way, this a-way
This a-way, this a-way
Lord I can't go a-home this a-way
If you miss the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
